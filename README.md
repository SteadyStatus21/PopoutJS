# iFrame Detection Popup
This repository contains JavaScript code that detects if a webpage is being loaded within an iFrame and displays a popup message recommending the user to view the page in a new tab. The purpose of this code is to ensure that the developer's work is properly viewed and graded by their teacher.

# Usage
To use this code, simply include it in your webpage's JavaScript file or embed it directly within a <script> tag. When the webpage is loaded within an iFrame, a popup will be displayed with the following options:

"Open in New Tab": This button opens the current page in a new tab.
"No, thanks": This button dismisses the popup without opening the page in a new tab.

### I have since deployed this to a CDN, where you can use the following code to embed it into your HTML file!
```HTML
<script src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/SteadyStatus21/PopoutJS/main/popout.js" defer></script>
```
